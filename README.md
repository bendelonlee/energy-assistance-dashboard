# ENERGY OUTREACH COLORADO
### KNOW THE TRUE LEVEL OF NEED IN CO

The general idea of the project is to provide an understanding of how much need is in a specific place.

The must haves of the project are that it:

1. Is printable. 
2. Easily used by non-technical users. This can be interpreted in two ways. One is just being able to provide a link to someone and then they have something they can reference and easily print out. The other way is whoever works

Stretch goal ideas:
* Automating data collection
* Add more types of data
